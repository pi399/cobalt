This is somewhat of a game engine, meant to simulate collisions and basic physics somewhat accurately. The primary goal, although it is still quite distant, is to provide a full featured game in Lua with collisions, sounds, music, and more. This is programmed in Lua using bundles and bundles of LÖVE.
