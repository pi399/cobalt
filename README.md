============

Copyright 2014 Ian DeWalt
This is somewhat of a game engine, meant to simulate collisions and basic physics somewhat accurately. Brett Sears has provided assistance in the development as well. This is programmed in Lua using LÖVE.

v.0.1: collision checking between just two objects works
v.0.2: collision checking between multiple objects works
v.0.3: can now load worlds
v.0.3.1: develops simple sprites for objects in a world
